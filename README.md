# Perishable Goods Management Analysis
## Project Summary
The project focuses on Perishable Goods Management and examines detailed information on perishable products across various categories and regions. The primary goal of the analysis is to identify patterns of waste within these products and to generate actionable insights that can enhance operational efficiency and increase profitability.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the waste of perishable goods exceeds 20%, which is more than the double of the recommended threshold of 10%.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, covers transactions from 2023 to 2024 across 20 stores located in 5 regions of the United States. It includes information on 10 product categories, inventory movements, logistics scores, profits, and costs. (Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/likithagedipudi/perishable-goods-management).

## Methodology
1. Python - Data cleaning and transformation
2. Excel - Consistency checks
3. Power BI - Data visualization and storytelling

## Key Analysis & Visualization
Amongst the 10 product categories, **Frozen Meals, Pharmaceuticals, Bakery, Beverages, and Meat product categories have the highest number of wasted units**. In terms of geographic rank, **Northeast is identified as the leading contributor of units wasted**, amounting to 1.62 million. This occurrence can be attributed to the level of the packaging of the product, as **the packaging score is reported to have a negative relationship with units wasted**. The **logistic performance of the product as well negatively affects a certain product category lifespan**. This is further corroborated by the product's sensitivity to spoilage in which both Pharmaceuticals and Meat product categories act preeminence in sensitivity to spoilage. In the overall management **the data revealed that there is an unbalanced check of demand and supply of products**, especially Frozen Meals and Pharmaceutical product categories.

## Recommendations
1. Enhance packaging standard and performance.
2. Improve logistic efforts and practices.
3. Conduct an in-depth demand analysis on Frozen Meals and Pharmaceutical products.
